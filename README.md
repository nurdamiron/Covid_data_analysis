# COVID-19 Data Analysis using Regression and Classification

This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data and predict the number of new cases and whether there will be an increase in new deaths using different machine learning algorithms. We will apply Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree algorithms for regression and classification tasks.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Data Preprocessing

1. Load the dataset from a CSV file.
2. Remove rows with missing values in the relevant columns.
3. Create a new binary column 'death_increase' indicating whether there is an increase in new deaths.
4. Select relevant features for prediction, such as 'population_density', 'gdp_per_capita', and 'median_age'.
5. Split the dataset into training and testing sets for both regression and classification tasks.

## Linear Regression

1. Initialize a Linear Regression model.
2. Fit the model to the training data.
3. Make predictions on the testing data.
4. Evaluate the model performance using mean squared error.

## Logistic Regression

1. Initialize a Logistic Regression model.
2. Fit the model to the training data.
3. Make predictions on the testing data.
4. Evaluate the model performance using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

## K-Nearest Neighbors

1. Initialize KNN Regression and Classification models.
2. Fit the models to the training data.
3. Make predictions on the testing data.
4. Evaluate the model performance using mean squared error for regression and accuracy score and confusion matrix for classification.

## Decision Tree

1. Initialize Decision Tree Regression and Classification models.
2. Fit the models to the training data.
3. Make predictions on the testing data.
4. Evaluate the model performance using mean squared error for regression and accuracy score and confusion matrix for classification.

To visualize the results, we will create scatter plots for regression models comparing actual and predicted values, and heatmaps for confusion matrices for classification models.
